# variable = saves value for re-use, can be updated
# variable naming convention: be descriptive, lower case, and separte words by underscores "_"

hello_world = 'Hello, World ' # assign a value to a variable on right hand side of equal sign
# hello_world is a variable with a string variable with a value assigned to it: 'Hello, World'

print(hello_world) # we call the variable with the print() in-built function, which calls the assigned value to it, which is 'Hello, World ' thus it prints
# 'Hello, World '

hello_world = 'World, Hello' #assign a different value to hello_world variable, basically overwritten the variable
print(hello_world) # now it doesnt print 'Hello, World ' but instead prints the new value, 'World, Hello

# we can reference variables as well, for example

hello_world2 = hello_world # hello_world2 contains the same value assigned to the variable hello_world. basically we  are referencing the variable hello_world
